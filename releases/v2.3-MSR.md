- Major organization of the code

## Additions
- Add a profile lookup command with multiple features such as looking up and selecting profiles in the same message, and viewing basic statistics about profiles such as coop members and creation/last seen times with discord's new timestamp system. (#24) (#29)
- Add ability to deny guild applications. (#28)
- Add `/hy` with 4 subcommands (`/hy profiles`, `/hy status`, `/hy counts`, `/hy banstats`).

## Future plans
- Add cogs (`commandListener.py` and `main.py` are still way too messy)

- v2.4 (later today?)
- v3.0 (sometime?)

### Notes:
This is the first time I'm using any formal release formatting, and I didn't document as many of the changes as I would like to have done.
