### Notes:
Sorry this took so long to release, but it's finally out and I can start working on other things now. Also I am kind of bored when writing these long patch notes, so I got to figure out a better system sometime. I know that I'm missing a lot of detail, and I'm trying to figure out how I can include the most info and get the best out of my issue system and what not.
